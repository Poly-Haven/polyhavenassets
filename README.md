## Features

1. Downloads all assets from [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/), and list them under their respective categories in the Asset Browser.
2. Lets you swap the resolution of an asset to higher/lower resolutions any time after import (most are at least 8K).
3. Set the texture mapping scale to the correct real-world size according to the surfaces you've applied it to.
4. One-click setup of texture displacement with adaptive subdivision.
5. Simple HDRI rotation, brightness, and color temperature sliders.

1. After enabling the add-on, [add a new Asset Library](https://file.coffee/u/sPrJY2-9578l2WjmmOA3n.png) in your preferences called `Poly Haven`. This is where assets will be downloaded to.
2. Open the asset browser editor and select the Poly Haven library at the top left.
3. Click the ***Fetch Assets*** button in the header of the asset browser.
4. After the initial download (which currently is around 3.3GB), simply drag and drop the assets into your scene.
5. We release new assets almost daily, so you can click that *Fetch Assets* button any time to download new assets.
